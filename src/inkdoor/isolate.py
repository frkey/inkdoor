"""Runs the reading of downloaded calendars in a child process, with a time limit.

A calendar is data from outside. A few hundred bytes of recurrence rules can expand into
millions of occurrences, or make the recurrence library walk years of seconds before it reaches
today. In the server's own process that would stall the render loop (the door would keep its old
status) or exhaust its memory. In a child it costs at most ``timeout`` seconds: the child is
killed and the source counts as failed, so the door falls back on that calendar's last good data
or "Knock first", never "Free".

Memory is bounded by what the child reads, not by a limit set here: the recurrence expansion is
lazy and capped (``sources.MAX_OCCURRENCES``). The service's seccomp filter
(``SystemCallFilter=~@resources``) kills a process that calls setrlimit, so the child sets none.

The child starts from a fork server where there is one (Linux, macOS): it forks from a small,
single-threaded process that has already imported the parsing code, so each run is cheap and
safe next to the server's threads. Elsewhere (Windows) it is spawned.
