"""Outbound requests and LAN address detection.

Every calendar or task link is fetched through `fetch`, which:

- caps the body (5 MB by default) and follows at most 3 redirects, by hand, so every hop can
  be checked;
- enforces a total deadline (30 s by default): each request gets timeouts clamped to the time
  left, and a watchdog shuts down the connection (http or https) when time runs out, so a
  server that trickles the TLS handshake, the headers or the body one byte at a time cannot hold
  a fetch past the deadline. Two steps cannot be cut: DNS lookups (bounded by the system
  resolver's own timeout) and the TCP connect (bounded by the clamped connect timeout, once per
  resolved address);
- refuses hosts that resolve to loopback, link-local (including the cloud metadata address
  169.254.169.254) or unspecified addresses, on every hop. Private LAN addresses (RFC 1918,
  IPv6 ULA) stay allowed on purpose: a calendar on a LAN Nextcloud or Radicale is a real use,
  so a link can still reach other machines on the LAN. That residual risk is accepted;
- never puts the link in an error. Links are secrets, and `requests` copies the URL path into
  its messages, so every failure becomes a `FetchError` that only carries a short reason, raised
  outside the original handler and `from None` so no chained exception survives.

Known limit, accepted: the host is resolved and checked before each request, and `requests`
resolves it again to connect. A DNS server that answers differently the second time (DNS
rebinding) can slip past the check.

    returns and the fetch fails with "timeout".

    The duplicate keeps working after TLS wraps (and detaches) the original socket, and since
    the watchdog owns it, its number cannot be reused by an unrelated socket. The watchdog never
